# Awesome-Personalized-Federated-Learning

Paper List for Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)

Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), allowing different parameters among clients, is designed for data heterogeneity (statistics heterogeneity) problem in federated learning.



We categorized PFL algorithms into four types and collected corresponding papers

+ **Parameters-based**: These algorithms emphasize personalization through their model parameters, enabling the customization of parameters within specific parts of the model.
+ **Full-personalization-based**: These algorithms tailor a personalized model for each client. The global information is injected via techniques like mix-up or global regularization.
+ **Similarity-based**: These algorithms focus on capturing the similarities among clients and aim to facilitate synergy between similar clients.
+ **Learn-to-personalize-based**: These algorithms are designed to identify methods for easily personalizing models locally.

A detailed mindmap of paper collected is illustrated as follow

We also collect PFL papers like

+ Per-instance PFL
+ PFL with Transformers
+ Out-of-distribution (OOD) in PFL
